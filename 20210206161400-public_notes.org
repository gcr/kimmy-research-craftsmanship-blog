[[file:20210206161400-public_notes.org][Public Notes]]

This tag marks the notes that I consider to be consistent with Google's employee communications policy regarding posts to public blogs.

Only notes bearing this tag will be marked for export.

- *Do NOT add this tag to notes that are Confidential or Need-to-know*
- *Do NOT add this tag to notes that reference internal information.*

Internal users, see the pubapproval FAQ (grep for "blog"). I believe this blog falls under the "Potential exceptions" number 2.
