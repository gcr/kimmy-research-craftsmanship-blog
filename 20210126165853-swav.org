https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09882: Unsupervised Learning of Visual Features by Contrasting Cluster Assignments. Mathilde Caron, Ishan Misra, Julien Mairal, Priya Goyal, Piotr Bojanowski, Armand Joulin

- Very conceptually similar to our [[file:20210127101746-manifold_proxies.org][Manifold Proxies]] work from 2019, but they got it working!

- The secret sauce is the [[file:20210204112740-sinkhorn_knopp_algorithm.org][Sinkhorn-Knopp Algorithm]], which normalizes the cluster assignments.

- *Question about swapping assignment:* How is it ensured that only full resolution views are used for code computation? There is a [[https://github.com/facebookresearch/swav/issues/19][github issue]] about this but both of us were still quite confused.

* Future thoughts
- Is this similar to [[file:20210127095517-mixmatch.org][MixMatch]]?
