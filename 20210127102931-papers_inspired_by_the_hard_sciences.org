- Okay so. In [[http://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/partition.html][Bengio's discussion on softmax (ch 18)]], he talks about how the term in the numerator of the softmax is a "positive phase" that brings the positive distribution up and the partition function is a "negative phase" that brings the distribution of "hallucination" or "fantasy points" as he calls them down. Then he likens this sort of reasoning to one theorized role of REM sleep in [[https://www.google.com/search?q=Crick+and+Mitchison%2C+1983&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS842US843&oq=Crick+and+Mitchison%2C+1983&aqs=chrome..69i57.3279j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8][Crick and Mitchison, 1983]]
