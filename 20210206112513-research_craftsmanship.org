I want to make a handbook for researchers, similar to the [[file:20210206112529-sre_book.org][SRE book]], that talks about research as a craft.

Want to make a handbook similar to [[file:20210204111537-sreedu.org][SREEDU]] and the [[file:20210206112529-sre_book.org][SRE book]] for the [[file:20210202193207-research_work_unit.org][Research workplace unit]]

  - [ ] what would an [[file:20210204111537-sreedu.org][SREEDU]] for research look like?
  - [ ] Good examples of [[file:20210206112308-research_journalss.org][research journals]]
  - [ ] Rich Hickey has some examples of research. [[file:20210206112600-couch_driven_research.org][Hammon-driven Development (Rich Hickey)]]
