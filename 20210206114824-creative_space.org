#+title: Creative Space

The rough draft.
The blank canvas.
The whiteboard.
The temporary folder.
The scratch disk.
A space where you can just vomit onto the page and explore new ideas.

I think the *crucial property* of creative spaces is *lack of self-judgment/shame*. You can feel comfortable just dumping shit there

Zero friction:
- from the tool you're working with
- from your own anxiety
- from structure ("do i need to format this a certain way", "do i need to lint", ...)
- from others

As a fundamentally creative pursuit, [[id:33013B29-EFA3-4A53-9E1C-8F7E222B9F82][Research Craftsmanship]] requires spaces like this to be able to quickly prototype ideas.

People don't often consider the [[file:20210204133357-infrastructure.org][Infrastructure]] needs of creative spaces. Often too much infrastructure imposes requirements on structure, cognitive dedication, etc. that create unnecessary friction.
