#+title: Anxiety-binding task
[[file:20210206161400-public_notes.org][Public Notes]]
A task that places a lower bound on my anxiety level.

*I need to complete these tasks to feel okay*: to feel useful, to feel productive, to feel "complete"

When left unresolved, these generate feelings of:
- "I'll get in trouble"
- "I'll feel left out"
